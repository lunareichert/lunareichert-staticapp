We caught her under the cover of night, our ship cutting through the waves like a cutlass through a bilge rat. With the wind at our backs and cannon fire in our wake, we boarded the vessel and claimed her bounty—gold, silver, and enough rum to make a man forget the sea herself!"

Aye, they chased us through the reefs of Shipwreck Cove, firing their cursed guns like Neptune’s own wrath!

The old salts whisper of this beast, sayin’ it guards a hidden trove deep beneath Skull Island.

We pressed on, driven by greed and the thrill of discovery, but when the storm rolled in and the sea itself seemed to rise against us, we knew it was time to turn back. No treasure’s worth the wrath of the deep."
